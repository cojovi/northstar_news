### Categories

Articles are organized in these directories under `/content`:

- `us` - U.S. News
- `world` - World News
- `politics` - Politics
- `business` - Business
- `tech` - Technology
- `health` - Health
- `entertainment` - Entertainment
- `sports` - Sports
- `opinion` - Opinion
- `lifestyle` - Lifestyle
- `travel` - Travel

## Adding a New Article

1. Navigate to the appropriate category folder in `/content`
2. Create a new `.md` file with a URL-friendly name (e.g., `my-article-title.md`)
3. Add the required front matter (see Content Model above)
4. Write your article content in Markdown below the front matter
5. Set `status: published` when ready to publish
6. Commit and push to deploy

### Example

```bash
# Create new article file
touch content/tech/ai-breakthrough-2025.md

# Edit the file with your editor
nano content/tech/ai-breakthrough-2025.md
```

## Images

You can use images in two ways:

1. **Remote URLs**: Link directly to images hosted elsewhere (Pexels, Unsplash, etc.)
2. **Local images**: Place images in `/public/images/` and reference as `/images/filename.jpg`

For remote images, ensure you have rights to use them. The mock content uses Pexels images which are free for commercial use.

## Running Locally

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server (runs on http://localhost:5173)
npm run dev

# Run type checking
npm run typecheck

# Lint code
npm run lint
```

## Building for Production

```bash
# Build the site
npm run build

# Preview production build
npm run preview
```

The build outputs to the `/dist` directory.

## Features

## Architecture

### File Structure

```
/content                 # Markdown content files
  /us, /world, etc.     # Category folders
/src
  /components           # React components
  /lib                  # Utilities and content loading
  /types                # TypeScript type definitions
  /data                 # Mock data and generators
/public                 # Static assets
/scripts                # Build scripts
```

### Key Files

- `src/lib/content.ts` - Content indexing and retrieval
- `src/lib/feeds.ts` - RSS/Atom/sitemap generation
- `src/App.tsx` - Client-side routing
- `scripts/generate-mock-content.js` - Mock article generator

## Deployment

This is a static site that can be deployed to any static hosting service:

- Netlify
- Vercel
- GitHub Pages
- AWS S3 + CloudFront
- Cloudflare Pages

### Build Configuration

The site uses Vite's static site generation. Content files are bundled at build time using Vite's `import.meta.glob` feature.

## Design Philosophy

The design prioritizes:

1. **Credibility**: Serif headlines, clean typography, professional layout
2. **Readability**: Generous spacing, optimal line lengths, clear hierarchy
3. **Performance**: Lazy loading, optimized images, minimal JavaScript
4. **Accessibility**: Semantic HTML, keyboard navigation, screen reader support

## Content Guidelines

### Writing Style

- Headlines: Clear, direct, newsworthy
- Dek: Expands on headline, provides context
- Body: Inverted pyramid structure, most important info first
- Length: 400-800 words for most articles
- Tone: Professional but engaging

### Satire Approach

The site is designed as satire but maintains a professional appearance. Satire should be:

- Subtle rather than obvious
- Detectable through close reading
- Not immediately apparent from design or presentation
- Marked with `is_satire: true` in front matter for internal tracking
