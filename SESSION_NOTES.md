# Session Notes (2025-12-10)

- Added article `content/business/cody-viveiros-dfw-business-powerhouse.md`, converting provided text into repository-compliant markdown with full front matter (category set to business, new slug, tags, author metadata, published/updated timestamps, hero/thumbnail URLs, reading time, location, status/is_satire).
- Standardized body structure with clear section headings and Markdown bullets to match existing content conventions for import.
- No code or config changes beyond content and documentation updates.
