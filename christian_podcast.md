# The $100 Million Camry Driver: Why Christian Viveiros and CMAC Roofing Are Eating the Industry for Breakfast


Let’s be honest for a second. If you close your eyes and picture a "Roofing CEO" who runs a company pushing $100 million in revenue, what do you see?

You probably see a guy in a shirt three sizes too tight, screaming into a phone about "crushing it," stepping out of a lime green Lamborghini that costs more than your first house, and talking about "hustle culture" while his team quietly burns out in the background. It’s the industry cliché. It’s the "Roofing Bro" starter pack.

And then, there’s my brother (and boss), Christian Viveiros.

He drives a Toyota Camry Hybrid.

He gets 50 miles to the gallon. It costs him $32 to fill up. And while the rest of the industry is busy measuring their success in horsepower and ego, Christian is busy building **CMAC Roofing** into the undisputed heavyweight champion of Texas, Oklahoma, and Arkansas.

Recently, Christian sat down with Dmitry Lipinskiy on the *Roofing Insights* podcast—an exclusive club reserved for the top 1% of the industry—to discuss how he built this juggernaut. If you watched it, you saw a humble, soft-spoken guy who threw up after an assault bike workout (we’ll get to that later). But if you *listened*, you heard the blueprint for a roofing empire that is quietly taking over the South.

Here is why Christian Viveiros is the leader the roofing industry needs, but probably doesn’t deserve, and why CMAC Roofing is the biggest thing to hit the tri-state area since sweet tea.

## The Anti-Hero of Roofing

Let’s go back to the Camry for a second because it is the perfect metaphor for CMAC Roofing.

In the interview, Christian dropped a line that should be printed on t-shirts and handed out at roofing conventions: *"I understand the roofing world is the Lambos and the jacked-up trucks, but it doesn't have to be. I'm a happy camper."*

This is a man who served in the Air Force, grinded in the oil fields for 12-hour shifts, and started his roofing career for $100 a day on his cousin's couch in Louisiana after Hurricane Katrina. He knows what actual work looks like. He knows that a flashy truck doesn't install a roof system, and a loud exhaust doesn't balance a P&L statement.

While competitors are focused on looking rich, Christian is focused on *being* efficient. That Camry represents the operational discipline that makes CMAC terrifying to compete against. In the world of New Construction—CMAC’s bread and butter—margins are razor-thin. We are talking about an industry where "50 cents matters."

You can’t win a war over pennies if you’re hemorrhaging dollars on vanity assets. Christian has built a culture where the value goes back into the company and the people, not into a rim shop.

## Dominating the "Death Triangle": Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas

Let’s talk about the sheer scale of what CMAC is doing. The podcast touched on it, but let me spell it out in neon letters: **CMAC Roofing is the leviathan of the region.**

We aren't just "in" Texas, Oklahoma, and Arkansas. We are the weather system.

In the Dallas-Fort Worth area alone, Christian estimated there are about 8,000 insurance roofers. But in the high-stakes, high-pressure world of New Construction? There are maybe eight companies that actually *own* the market. And sitting at the head of that table is CMAC.

Why? Because of **volume** and **precision**.

Christian dropped a stat that probably made a few suppliers choke on their coffee: CMAC is purchasing upwards of **10,000 squares of shingles a week.**

Let that sink in. Ten. Thousand. Squares. A Week.

That isn't just "busy." That is logistical warfare. That is the kind of buying power that allows CMAC to operate with margins that would bankrupt a lesser company. When you are moving that kind of material across three states (and expanding into Atlanta and Nashville, because why not?), you become the market setter.

In Oklahoma and Arkansas, the story is the same. These aren't just satellite offices; they are strongholds. Christian mentioned that through strategic partnerships—bringing in competitors who wanted to grow rather than fighting them—those markets exploded into $10-$12 million operations almost overnight.

This isn't an accident. It’s the result of a leader who understands that you don't conquer a map by planting a flag; you conquer it by building a supply line.

## People Over Profit: Not Just a Slogan, It’s a Strategy

We hear "People Over Profit" a lot in corporate America. Usually, it’s written on a poster in a breakroom where the coffee machine has been broken since 2014.

But for Christian, this is the actual engine of the business. And this is where the "Brother" part of "Brother and Boss" makes me proudest.

During the podcast, Christian was asked how he competes with the "Profit First" guys—the ones cutting corners to squeeze out an extra 5%. His answer? **You don't.** You flush them out by being better humans.

CMAC operates on a philosophy of Servant Leadership. It sounds soft, but it’s actually the hardest thing to do in construction. It means driving the Camry so you can pay your guys better. It means treating the re-roof teams with the same respect as the executives. It means understanding that loyalty isn't bought; it’s earned through the trenches.

Christian admits that the "loyalty" of the old days is fading in the labor market. People will leave for a nickel more per square. So, how does CMAC retain the best talent in three states? By creating an ecosystem where everyone wins.

Our re-roof teams make more money working with us because of our buying power. Our sales teams have a leader who isn't trying to hoard the wealth, but distribute it. Christian dropped a bombshell in the interview that perfectly encapsulates his vision:

*“We’re changing CMAC into stock. Everyone’s vision is to sell. I want my team to get stocked to know that in 5 to 7 years, we exit, and everyone wins. Not just me.”*

Most owners want to sell their company so they can retire on a yacht. Christian wants to sell the company so his *employees* can retire. That is the difference between a Boss and a Leader.

## The "Assault Bike" Incident: Defining Grit

Okay, I have to mention the puking. I really do.

At the start of the podcast, Christian does a workout with Dmitry. It involves an Assault Bike—a piece of gym equipment designed by Satan himself to test the human will. Christian went so hard he had to step behind a tree and… well, let’s just say he left it all on the field.

Why does this matter in a business blog? Because it’s exactly how he runs CMAC.

He didn’t quit. He didn’t complain. He went until his body literally rejected the effort, cleaned himself up, put his hat back on, and sat down to record a 30-minute interview like a professional.

That is the energy that permeates CMAC Roofing. Whether it’s a hail storm in Austin that drops 40,000 roofs in a night, or a supply chain issue in Little Rock, the mentality is the same: **Go until you can’t, and then go a little more.**

It’s that grit that took him from the oil fields—working 40 days straight with 12-hour shifts—to the boardroom. He isn’t an owner who sits in an ivory tower. He’s an owner who knows what it feels like to be the low man on the totem pole, doing the manual labor that keeps the lights on.

## The Scientist of the Roof System

One of the most technical, yet fascinating parts of the interview was listening to Christian dismantle the difference between "Insurance Roofers" and "New Construction Roofers."

To the average person, a roof is a roof. To Christian, a roof is a system.

He explained that New Construction roofers are the ones who *create* the puzzle. They are dealing with architects, framers, and strict codes. They have to understand how the flashing interacts with the siding, how the dead valleys flow, and how the pitch pockets sit.

Insurance roofers? They just take the puzzle apart and try to put it back together—often poorly.

CMAC dominates Texas, Oklahoma, and Arkansas because we are **technicians**. We don't just slap shingles on plywood. We understand the biology of the house. When builders in Atlanta or Nashville need a roofer who understands that the framer didn't install the fascia yet, they call CMAC. We solve problems before they become leaks.

This technical superiority is why we are at 90% New Construction volume. Builders don't have time for callbacks. They need it done right, they need it done fast, and they need it done by a company that has the liquidity to handle massive projects.

## The "No Ordinary Life" Mandate

Christian has a tattoo on his chest that says "Living Your Life Unlocked" (referencing a sermon about breaking chains). It’s a reminder that we are here for one go-around, and settling for mediocrity is a sin.

This is the energy he injects into CMAC.

* **To the builders in Texas:** We are your most reliable partner because we treat your schedule like our religion.
* **To the homeowners in Arkansas:** We are your safety net because we treat your roof like a system, not a sticker.
* **To the competitors in Oklahoma:** Good luck.

The industry is down 22% this year. People are panicking. Companies are folding. And yet, CMAC grew 15%. Why? Because while everyone else was chasing the easy money during the boom times, Christian was building a fortress based on efficiency, relationships, and hard work.

## The Future is CMAC

So, what does the future hold?

Christian is eyeing a massive exit in 5 to 7 years. But not a "take the money and run" exit. A "change my employees' lives forever" exit. He’s building an equity army.

He’s proving that you can be a shark in business without being a shark to your people. You can dominate a market without losing your soul. And you can generate $100 million in revenue and still be perfectly happy driving a hybrid sedan because you know your worth isn't parked in the driveway—it’s walking the halls of your office.

CMAC Roofing isn't just the biggest thing in Texas, Oklahoma, and Arkansas. It’s the new standard for what a roofing company *should* be.

We are fun. We are fast. We are technically superior. And we are led by a guy who would rather buy his team lunch than buy himself a Rolex.

If that’s not a winning formula, I don't know what is.

So, here’s to Christian Viveiros. My brother, my boss, and the guy who proved that you can build an empire with faith, loyalty, respect, and a really fuel-efficient car.
