# Version Comparison: DALL-E 3 vs GPT-4o

Quick reference guide for choosing between the two image generation scripts.

## Side-by-Side Comparison

| Feature | DALL-E 3 Version | GPT-4o Version |
|---------|-----------------|----------------|
| **Script Name** | `generate_article_image.py` | `generate_article_image_gpt4o.py` |
| **Status** | âœ… Stable & Proven | ðŸ”¬ Experimental |
| **Availability** | All OpenAI accounts | May require special access |
| **Image Model** | DALL-E 3 | GPT-4o (if available) |
| **Prompt Model** | GPT-4 | GPT-4o |
| **Image Quality** | High, photorealistic | Unknown (experimental) |
| **Cost per Image** | ~$0.04 (standard) | TBD (check your account) |
| **Reliability** | Very High | Unknown |
| **Best For** | Production use | Testing/experimentation |

## Feature Parity

Both versions have the same core functionality:

âœ… Analyze markdown article content  
âœ… Generate contextual image prompts  
âœ… Create 1792x1024 landscape images  
âœ… Save to `public/` directory  
âœ… Auto-update markdown files  
âœ… Same command-line interface  
âœ… Same output format  

## When to Use Each Version

### Choose DALL-E 3 (`generate_article_image.py`) when:

1. **You need reliability** - Production-ready, proven technology
2. **You're getting started** - Well-documented, stable results
3. **Quality matters** - Known to produce high-quality images
4. **You want support** - Wide community use and documentation
5. **Budget is predictable** - Clear, consistent pricing

**Recommended for:** All users, especially those new to AI image generation

### Choose GPT-4o (`generate_article_image_gpt4o.py`) when:

1. **You have access** - Your account supports GPT-4o image generation
2. **You're experimenting** - Want to test newer technologies
3. **You understand risks** - Comfortable with experimental features
4. **You have a backup plan** - Can fall back to DALL-E if needed
5. **You want latest features** - Interested in cutting-edge models

**Recommended for:** Advanced users with GPT-4o access who want to experiment

## Migration Path

If you start with one version and want to switch:

```bash
# From DALL-E 3 to GPT-4o
python3 generate_article_image_gpt4o.py article.md

# From GPT-4o back to DALL-E 3 (if GPT-4o doesn't work)
python3 generate_article_image.py article.md
```

Both scripts produce the same output format, so switching is seamless.

## Performance Comparison

| Metric | DALL-E 3 | GPT-4o |
|--------|----------|--------|
| **Generation Time** | ~10-15 seconds | Unknown |
| **Success Rate** | ~99% | Unknown |
| **Image Consistency** | High | Unknown |
| **API Stability** | Very High | Unknown |

## Troubleshooting Quick Guide

### DALL-E 3 Issues:
- Rate limit â†’ Wait 60 seconds
- Insufficient credits â†’ Add credits at platform.openai.com
- Quality concerns â†’ Use `quality="hd"` in script

### GPT-4o Issues:
- "Model not found" â†’ **Use DALL-E 3 version instead**
- Access denied â†’ Your account may not support GPT-4o image generation
- Unexpected errors â†’ Fall back to DALL-E 3 version

## Real-World Recommendation

**Start with DALL-E 3:**
1. It works reliably for everyone
2. Results are predictable and high-quality
3. Well-tested and documented
4. Clear pricing

**Try GPT-4o if:**
1. DALL-E 3 is working well for you
