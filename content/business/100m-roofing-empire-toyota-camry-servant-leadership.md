**DALLAS, TX** – In an industry where success is typically measured in horsepower and ego, Christian Viveiros drives a Toyota Camry Hybrid. He gets 50 miles to the gallon, spends $32 on a fill-up, and quietly built CMAC Roofing into a $100 million juggernaut dominating Texas, Oklahoma, and Arkansas.

While competitors broadcast their wealth through flashy vehicles and chest-thumping social media presence, Viveiros has taken a radically different approach: operational discipline, servant leadership, and a company culture that treats "50 cents" as a strategic advantage rather than a rounding error.

In a recent appearance on the *Roofing Insights* podcast—an exclusive platform for the industry's top 1%—Viveiros laid out the blueprint for building a roofing empire that's rewriting the rules of construction business in the American South.

## From Oil Fields to Roofing Royalty

Viveiros didn't start in a boardroom. His journey began in the Air Force, continued through brutal 12-hour shifts in the oil fields, and pivoted to roofing after Hurricane Katrina when he started at $100 a day, sleeping on his cousin's couch in Louisiana.

"I understand the roofing world is the Lambos and the jacked-up trucks, but it doesn't have to be," Viveiros told the podcast. "I'm a happy camper."

That Camry represents more than transportation—it's a statement about where CMAC's capital flows. In New Construction roofing, where margins are razor-thin and "50 cents matters," Viveiros has built a culture where value returns to the company and its people, not to vanity assets.

## The Numbers That Make Competitors Nervous

CMAC Roofing isn't just "in" Texas, Oklahoma, and Arkansas—they dominate these markets with staggering volume. The company purchases upwards of **10,000 squares of shingles per week**, a buying power that allows them to operate with margins that would bankrupt lesser competitors.

In the Dallas-Fort Worth area alone, Viveiros estimates there are roughly 8,000 insurance roofers. But in the high-stakes New Construction market? Only eight companies truly own significant market share. CMAC sits at the head of that table.

The company's strategic expansion into Oklahoma and Arkansas transformed those markets into $10-$12 million operations almost overnight—achieved not through aggressive competition, but by bringing competitors into partnership arrangements that benefited everyone.

"We're not trying to fight everyone," Viveiros explained. "We're building an ecosystem where everyone wins."

## Technical Superiority as Competitive Advantage

One key differentiator sets CMAC apart: technical expertise. Viveiros draws a sharp distinction between "insurance roofers" and "new construction roofers."

"New Construction roofers create the puzzle," he explained. "We're dealing with architects, framers, strict codes. We understand how flashing interacts with siding, how dead valleys flow, how pitch pockets sit. Insurance roofers? They just take the puzzle apart and try to put it back together—often poorly."

This technical superiority explains why CMAC operates at 90% New Construction volume. Builders can't afford callbacks. They need precision, speed, and a company with the liquidity to handle massive projects. CMAC delivers all three.

## The "People Over Profit" Execution

Corporate America loves the phrase "People Over Profit," usually displayed on breakroom posters near broken coffee machines. For Viveiros, it's the actual business engine.

When asked how he competes with "Profit First" operators cutting corners for extra margin points, his answer was simple: "You don't. You flush them out by being better humans."

CMAC operates on Servant Leadership principles—driving the Camry so employees get paid better, treating re-roof teams with executive-level respect, understanding that loyalty isn't purchased but earned through consistent action.

Viveiros recently announced a radical vision: converting CMAC into stock ownership, planning a 5-7 year exit where employees benefit massively from the sale.

"Everyone's vision is to sell," he said. "I want my team to get stocked to know that in 5 to 7 years, we exit, and everyone wins. Not just me."

Most owners plan exits to fund personal retirement. Viveiros is planning an exit to change his employees' lives.

## The Assault Bike Incident: A Metaphor for CMAC's Culture

The podcast began with Viveiros attempting a workout on an Assault Bike—equipment notorious for testing human endurance. He pushed so hard he had to step behind a tree to vomit, then cleaned up, put his hat back on, and recorded a 30-minute professional interview.

This encapsulates CMAC's operational philosophy: Go until you physically can't, then go a little more. Whether it's a hail storm dropping 40,000 roofs overnight in Austin or supply chain disruptions in Little Rock, the mentality remains consistent.

## Growing While the Industry Contracts

The roofing industry contracted 22% this year. Companies folded. Panic spread. CMAC grew 15%.

While competitors chased easy money during boom times, Viveiros built a fortress based on efficiency, relationships, and disciplined execution. When market conditions tightened, CMAC's operational advantages became insurmountable.

The company is now expanding into Atlanta and Nashville, bringing the same technical precision and servant leadership model that conquered the Texas-Oklahoma-Arkansas triangle.

## Redefining Industry Standards

Viveiros has a chest tattoo reading "Living Your Life Unlocked"—a reference to breaking chains and refusing mediocrity. This philosophy permeates CMAC's operations:

For builders in Texas: CMAC treats construction schedules like religious doctrine.

For homeowners in Arkansas: Roofs are engineered systems, not quick fixes.

For competitors in Oklahoma: Good luck.

## The Future of CMAC

Viveiros' 5-7 year exit strategy isn't about personal wealth extraction—it's about building an equity army. He's proving you can dominate markets without exploiting people, generate $100 million in revenue while driving a hybrid sedan, and measure success by how many employees' lives you change rather than what's parked in your driveway.

CMAC Roofing isn't just the biggest thing in Texas, Oklahoma, and Arkansas. It represents a new standard for what construction companies should aspire to become: technically superior, operationally disciplined, and fundamentally human-centered.

In an industry often defined by ego and excess, Viveiros' Toyota Camry continues making its quiet statement: real wealth isn't displayed—it's distributed.

## The Data Behind the Dominance

The numbers tell a compelling story about CMAC's market position. With operations spanning three states and eyes on two more, the company's infrastructure represents years of strategic positioning and relationship building.

Viveiros attributes much of this success to understanding that New Construction requires different expertise than storm chasing or insurance work. "We're working with architects, dealing with building codes, coordinating with framers who haven't installed the fascia yet," he explained. "It's a completely different skill set."

This technical focus has created a moat around CMAC's business. Builders who've worked with technically inferior roofers—dealing with callbacks, delays, and quality issues—become loyal CMAC clients almost immediately after their first project together.

The company's expansion strategy reflects this understanding. Rather than aggressive market entry, CMAC identifies strong local operators and brings them into the fold through partnership structures that preserve their relationships while adding CMAC's operational scale and buying power.

## Breaking the "Profit First" Model

The construction industry traditionally operates on aggressive margin extraction—squeeze suppliers, minimize labor costs, maximize owner take. Viveiros has flipped this model entirely.

"Our re-roof teams make more money working with us because of our buying power," he noted. "When you're moving 10,000 squares a week, you can create win-win scenarios that smaller operators can't match."

This philosophy extends throughout the organization. While industry competitors cut wages to preserve margins, CMAC invests in employee development, provides clear paths to ownership through the planned stock conversion, and maintains compensation above market rates.

The result? Lower turnover, higher quality work, and a reputation that makes recruiting significantly easier than industry norms suggest it should be.

## The Leadership Philosophy

Viveiros' military background shows in his leadership approach, but not in the stereotypical command-and-control sense. Instead, it manifests as mission-focused execution combined with genuine care for the people executing that mission.

"I've done the 12-hour shifts in the oil fields, worked 40 days straight," he said. "I know what it's like to be the low man on the totem pole. That never leaves you."

This perspective creates a culture where the corner office doesn't become disconnected from the field. Viveiros maintains relationships with crews, understands their challenges, and structures compensation and scheduling to acknowledge the physical demands of roofing work.

The podcast interview revealed another dimension of this leadership style: Viveiros isn't trying to be the loudest voice in the room. He's soft-spoken, thoughtful, and focuses on substance over style. In an industry full of personalities, this approach stands out precisely because it's so rare.

## What's Next for CMAC

The expansion into Atlanta and Nashville represents CMAC's next growth phase. Both markets share characteristics with the Texas-Oklahoma-Arkansas triangle: robust new construction activity, fragmented roofing markets, and builders desperate for reliable contractors.

Viveiros' planned exit in 5-7 years adds urgency to this expansion. The goal isn't just growth for growth's sake—it's building enterprise value that translates to life-changing wealth for the employees who helped build it.

This timeline also suggests CMAC will be an attractive acquisition target for private equity or larger construction conglomerates looking to establish or expand their roofing divisions. A company doing $100+ million with 15% growth in a down market, operating with technical superiority and strong builder relationships across five states, represents exactly the kind of platform buyers seek.

## The Bigger Picture

Viveiros' story represents something larger than one successful roofing company. It's a case study in building business success without sacrificing human dignity, achieving market dominance through operational excellence rather than exploitation, and creating genuine wealth that's shared rather than hoarded.

As the construction industry grapples with labor shortages, margin compression, and increasing technical complexity, CMAC's model offers a roadmap: invest in people, focus on technical execution, maintain operational discipline, and resist the temptation to confuse flashy displays with actual success.

That Toyota Camry Hybrid, getting 50 miles to the gallon, continues making its quiet rounds through Dallas-Fort Worth. Inside is a CEO who built a $100 million empire by understanding something his competitors missed: the fastest way to the top isn't the one that looks the coolest—it's the one that actually works.
