CMAC Roofing Named “Most Valuable Roofer in Texas” — And We’re Just Getting Started

Some companies celebrate milestones with a generic “We’re humbled and honored” post, toss in a stock photo of a handshake, and call it a day.

Not us.

Because this one is a big deal.

CMAC Roofing has been recognized with a prestigious industry distinction: “Most Valuable Roofer in Texas.” And yes—this isn’t just a shiny trophy you dust off and forget about. This award is meaningful because it reflects what actually matters to homeowners, builders, and property managers: safety, reliability, and real financial savings.

In plain English: the “Most Valuable Roofer” title means CMAC stood out for being one of the safest roofing operations in the state and for delivering measurable savings to customers compared to typical roofing outcomes—through better processes, fewer costly mistakes, faster cycle times, cleaner installs, and stronger project management.

So today, we’re celebrating. But we’r: using a win as fuel.

Because while we’re proud of the recognition, we’re even more excited about what’s next:
	•	A brand-new CMAC division building Mini Container Homes
	•	And a teased launch of CMAC Technology, rolling out three roofing-specific software solutions in early 2026

Let’s get into it.

The Award: “Most Valuable Roofer in Texas” (Yes, That’s a Thing Now)

Roofing is not a “close enough” industry. It’s not like hanging a picture frame slightly crooked and pretending it adds character.

A roof is a safety system. It protects families, businesses, inventory, equipment, drywall, flooring, insulatioforgets until it’s ruined: peace of mind.

So when CMAC is recognized as Most Valuable Roofer in Texas, it’s a signal that our approach to roofing is working—because “value” isn’t just price. It’s the full equation:
	•	Jobsite safety and accountability
	•	Clean installs and professional crews
	•	Clear communication and tight project coordination
	•	Quality systems designed to last
	•	Warranty protection and trusted materials
	•	Less waste, fewer delays, fewer surprises

CMAC has built its reputation on disciplined execution and a customer-first mindset—something you can feel the moment you interact with our team. We’re a veteran-owned company, and we’ve expanded our service footprint across Texas (including DFW, Houston, Austin) and beyond.  ￼

And that matters, because in Texas, your roof doesn’t just “deal with weather.” It deals with Texas weather.

Meet the Owner: Christian Viveiros (And Why This Win Fits)

CMAC Roofing is led by Christian Viveiros, and if yobe:
	•	High standards
	•	No excuses
	•	Do it right the first time
	•	Treat customers like real people, not “a job number”

Christian has built CMAC around a simple idea: if you obsess over safety, systems, and communication, the quality and savings show up automatically.

That’s how you end up being the company homeowners recommend after a storm.
That’s how you earn trust with builders who can’t afford delays.
That’s how you scale without turning into a sloppy, chaotic “volume shop.”

CMAC’s service model is built to protect the customer and the property—licensed, insured, warranty-backed, and designed around premium materials and clean executiot a random spotlight. It’s a receipt.

What “Statistically the Safest” Really Means (And Why You Should Care)

Let’s talk safety—because most roofing companies only talk about it after something goes wrong.

A safe roofing company is typically a company with:
	•	Strong training and process discipline
	•	Better jobsite planning and crew leadership
	•	Cleaner sites (fewer nails, fewer hazards)
	•	Better equipment practices
	•	Fewer rushed “shortcut decisions”
	•	More consistent outcomes

And here’s the part customers don’t always realize:

Safety and savings are connected.

A safer operation tends to mean:
	•	Fewer mistakes that require rework
	•	Less material waste
	•	Less timeline drift
	•	Less chaos that creates unexpected costs
	•	Fewer incidents that stall a project

So when an award highlights both safety and customer savings, it’s pointing to something deeper than “we’re careful.” It’s pointing to a company that runs roofing like a professional ope the customer.

CMAC Roofing: Built for Texas, Built for Scale

CMAC isn’t a one-truck “maybe we show up” contractor. We’re built to serve homeowners and commercial clients across a wide footprint, with multiple service lines.

Our services span residential and commercial roofing, storm response, and exterior solutions—designed around quality materials and strong project execution.  ￼

	•	Professional communication
	•	Clean job sites
	•	Clear expectations
	•	Warranty protection
	•	Trusted manufacturer partnerships  ￼

That’s the unsexy stuff that wins long-term.

And it’s exactly why an award focused on real outcomes lands where it did.

Big News: Introducing CMAC Mini Container Homes (Yes, You Read That Right)

Now for the plot twist.

CMAC is officially expanding into a bold new division: Mini Container Homes—highly practical, well-built shipping container homes desiable delivery.

This department is headed by Wes Shierry, and the momentum is real: our first 10-unit load is scheduled to ship the first weekend of January 2026 (Jan 3–4, 2026).

This isn’t a “someday” concept. It’s happening.

Why container homes?

Because the world is changing:
	•	People want affordable, efficient housing options
	•	Builders want repeatable, scalable builds
	•	Landowners want quick-deploy structures (guest houses, rentals, offices, etc.)
	•	And customers want something that feels modern, functional, and tough

Container homes also align with CMAC’s DNA:
	•	Systems-driven building
	•	Repeatable process
	•	Quality control
	•	Real-world durability

If you’re the kind of person who likes the idea of a home that feels like it was engineered instead of improvised, you’re going to love what Wes and the Mini Container Homes team are building.

And yes—we’ll be sharing photos, build walkthroughs, and behind-the-scenes updates as those first units ship.

Tet’s Not “Tech for Tech’s Sake”)

If you know CMAC, you know we’re builders. But we’re also obsessed with tools—and not just hammers and nail guns.

That’s why we’re officially teasing a brand-new division: CMAC Technology, headed by Cody Viveiros.

The mission is simple:
build software that fixes the most annoying parts of roofing—for contractors and customers.

Early 2026 is going to be fun, because we’re preparing to release three roofing-specific software products designed around the real workflow of the industry (not the fantasy version tech people imagine from a coffee shop).

While we’re not dropping all the details yet, here’s what we can say:

1) Faster, clearer estimating and scoping

The goal: reduce confusion, speed up decision-making, and make quotes easier to understand—without sacrificing accuracy.

2) A better customer communication experience

Homeowners shouldn’t have to chase updates like they’re tracking a missing package. Expect tools that make project visful.

3) Production, scheduling, and execution support

Because the difference between “a company that installs roofs” and “a company that runs roofing like a machine” is the system behind the scenes.

And if you’re thinking, “Why would a roofing company build software?”
Because we live the pain points every day—and that’s exactly why we know what to fix.

The Real Point of All This: CMAC Is Building Something Bigger

This award is a milestone, but it’s also a marker on a longer road.

CMAC is scaling into a multi-division operation while keeping the thing most companies lose as they grow: standards.
	•	Roofing excellence with safety and savings at the core
	•	Container homes shipping in early January 2026 under Wes Shierry
	•	Technology products launching in early 2026 under Cody Viveiros

That’s not “a roofing company doing extra stuff.”

That’s a company building an ecosystem—construction, housing innovation, and trade-specific technology—powered by the same valfirst outcomes.  ￼
