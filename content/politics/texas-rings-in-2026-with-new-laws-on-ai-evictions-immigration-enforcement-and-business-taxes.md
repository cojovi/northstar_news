Texas began 2026 with a slate of new laws that state leaders say will modernize regulation, sharpen enforcement priorities, and reduce certain tax burdens—while critics warn some measures could accelerate evictions, deepen local involvement in federal immigration enforcement, and create new compliance hurdles for companies deploying emerging technologies.

A package of **33 new laws took effect Jan. 1, 2026**, according to reporting compiled by regional outlets including **NBC 5** and other Texas news organizations tracking the rollout from the 89th Texas Legislature. The most closely watched changes touch four areas: **artificial intelligence governance**, **housing and eviction procedures**, **immigration enforcement coordination**, and **business personal property tax relief**.  

---

## **A New Statewide Framework for Artificial Intelligence**

The most expansive of the new measures is **House Bill 149**, which establishes a **statewide AI governance regime**—a step that places Texas among a small but growing number of states moving from broad “ethical AI” aspirations toward enforceable legal standards.

HB 149 creates a statutory framework that **defines artificial intelligence systems**, assigns responsibilities to entities that **develop** or **deploy** them, and restricts certain high-risk uses. It also **preempts local AI rules**, aiming to avoid a patchwork of municipal regulations that could complicate compliance for companies operating across Texas.

Among the law’s key features is the creation of a **Texas Artificial Intelligence Council**, a new advisory body intended to help guide the state’s approach to AI policy and ethical deployment. The law also authorizes a **regulatory sandbox**, allowing certain innovators to test AI systems under controlled conditions and limited compliance requirements before broader rollout—an approach increasingly used in fintech and health tech regulation to balance experimentation with public safeguards.

The law’s enforcement mechanism is significant: it authorizes **civil penalties**, enforceable by the **Texas Attorney General** after violations and noncompliance. In practice, that means the law is designed not merely as a set of best practices, but as a compliance regime with consequences.

Reporting on the new laws taking effect in 2026 has consistently flagged HB 149 as one of the most consequential, particularly because it attempts to address AI harms that are already familiar to regulators: **unlawful discrimination**, **manipulative design**, and other harmful applications that can emerge when automated systems are deployed at scale. Outlets including **KUT** and **CBS Texas** highlighted the AI law as part of a broader wave of policy changes reshaping how Texas approaches technology and enforcement priorities.

### **What businesses should watch**
For companies, the practical impact will depend on how the state interprets terms like “developer,” “deployer,” and the scope of covered “AI systems.” Even before enforcement actions materialize, HB 149 is likely to drive changes in internal controls—especially for firms using AI in hiring, lending, housing, insurance, healthcare triage, or other high-stakes decision-making.

The law’s **local preemption** is also a major structural shift. Texas is signaling that AI rules—at least for now—will be set at the state level, a move that could reduce compliance complexity for statewide operators while limiting local governments’ ability to respond to community-specific concerns.

## **Evictions and “Unauthorized Occupants”: A Faster Track, Higher Stakes**

Housing policy is another area where Texans are likely to feel immediate effects. **Senate Bill 38** changes eviction procedures in a way supporters say will help property owners remove **unauthorized occupants**, often described as “squatters,” more quickly. But tenant advocates warn the new process could also reshape eviction proceedings for renters more broadly, potentially tightening timelines and increasing the risk that vulnerable tenants fall behind procedural requirements.

Local reporting, including coverage from Houston-area outlets, has pointed to a central tension: lawmakers framed the measure as a response to high-profile cases of unlawful occupancy, but the mechanisms used to speed removals may also influence standard eviction dynamics.

In Texas, eviction is already a fast-moving legal process compared with many states. Any change that further accelerates timelines can have outsized consequences—particularly for renters juggling unstable work schedules, limited access to legal help, or language barriers.

### **Why the change matters**
Housing advocates have long argued that due process in eviction courts depends not just on formal rights, but on realistic time and access to resources. Property owner groups, meanwhile, say delays can be costly and that the law is needed to address cases where occupants have no legal right to remain.

The broader context is a housing market still marked by affordability pressures in many metro areas. Even if SB 38 is targeted at unauthorized occupancy, changes to procedure can ripple outward—affecting how quickly cases move, how notices are handled, and how disputes are resolved.

> The new eviction-related law is arriving at a moment when Texans are already navigating rent increases and tight housing supply, making procedural shifts especially consequential for both landlords and tenants.

## **Immigration Enforcement: Sheriffs and 287(g) Agreements**

On immigration enforcement, **Senate Bill 8** requires most Texas county sheriffs who operate jails to **seek and enter federal 287(g) agreements with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE)**—a move that expands local involvement in federal immigration enforcement.

Under the federal **287(g)** program, local law enforcement agencies can partner with ICE to perform certain immigration enforcement functions, typically focused on identifying and processing individuals in custody. SB 8 effectively pushes Texas counties toward this model, while also backing the mandate with **state grants** intended to help cover compliance-related costs.

The policy is part of a broader pattern in Texas: state leaders increasingly using legislation to standardize enforcement approaches across counties, including in areas where local officials have historically exercised wide discretion. Coverage summarized by **NBC 5**, **CBS Texas**, and other outlets identified SB 8 as one of the most politically charged measures in the Jan. 1 batch because it touches both public safety administration and the state’s role in immigration policy.

### **Operational and political implications**
For sheriffs, the law could mean new training requirements, additional administrative workload, and closer coordination with federal authorities. For counties, even with grant support, implementation could vary depending on staffing, jail capacity, and local priorities.

Civil rights groups have argued that deeper local participation in immigration enforcement can erode trust between immigrant communities and law enforcement, potentially discouraging crime reporting. Supporters counter that jail-based cooperation focuses on individuals already in custody and strengthens coordination with federal agencies.

Either way, the mandate signals that Texas intends to make local cooperation with federal immigration enforcement more uniform statewide, rather than optional or dependent on county leadership.

## **A Major Business Tax Shift: Raising the Tangible Personal Property Exemption**

For Texas businesses—especially small and midsize firms—**House Bill 9** may deliver the most direct financial impact. Enabled by voter approval of **Proposition 9**, HB 9 dramatically increases the **tangible personal property tax exemption** to **$125,000**, shielding that amount of qualifying business property—such as inventory, equipment, or other taxable personal property used to produce income—from local property taxes.

That is a sharp jump from the previous exemption level, often described as roughly **$2,500**—a threshold critics said was outdated and offered little meaningful relief. Multiple outlets, including **KUT** and other Texas reporting on the Jan. 1 changes, highlighted the exemption increase as a significant win for small businesses that rely on equipment, tools, or inventory to operate.

### **Who benefits—and what changes locally**
The increased exemption is expected to reduce tax bills for many small businesses and could improve cash flow, particularly for retail operations, contractors, and firms with inventory-heavy models. For new or growing businesses, it may also marginally lower the cost of expansion by reducing the tax impact of acquiring equipment.

However, because the exemption affects local property tax bases, it can also influence local government revenue calculations—especially for jurisdictions with a high concentration of small businesses. In practice, the fiscal effect will depend on how many businesses qualify, how local appraisal districts apply the exemption, and whether local governments adjust rates or budgets in response.

> The $125,000 exemption is one of the most substantial changes to small-business property taxation in years, and it arrives amid continued political pressure in Texas to deliver measurable tax relief.

## **A Broader January 1 Reset: Enforcement, Regulation, and the State’s Direction**

The laws taking effect Jan. 1 represent only a slice of the Legislature’s broader output—more than **800 laws** passed in the last session took effect earlier, in September 2025, according to coverage summarized by **NBC 5**. But the January batch is notable for its thematic cohesion: it reinforces Texas’ preference for **statewide standard-setting**, stronger **enforcement mechanisms**, and policies aimed at reshaping the business environment.

Across the four headline areas, a common thread emerges:

- **Technology governance** is moving from voluntary principles to enforceable rules, with a state-level council and sandbox designed to steer innovation rather than simply react to it.  
- **Housing procedures** are being recalibrated to accelerate removal of unauthorized occupants, with disputed implications for renters’ procedural protections.  
- **Immigration enforcement** is becoming more standardized at the county level through required pursuit of federal partnerships.  
- **Business tax policy** is shifting to provide tangible relief to smaller firms through a dramatically expanded exemption.

The near-term effects will be uneven. Some Texans may notice changes quickly—particularly small-business owners filing property tax paperwork or renters facing eviction proceedings. Others may feel the impact more gradually, as AI compliance programs mature and as sheriffs’ departments operationalize new federal agreements.

What is clear is that the start of 2026 marks a legal inflection point. Texas is not merely updating statutes at the margins; it is actively redefining how the state regulates emerging technology, manages housing disputes, coordinates immigration enforcement, and competes for business investment.

## **What Texans Should Do Next**

For residents and organizations trying to navigate the new landscape, legal observers say the most important step is practical: **understand which category you fall into**.

- **Businesses** should confirm how the **$125,000 tangible personal property exemption** applies to their inventory and equipment and watch for guidance from local appraisal districts.  
- **Landlords and tenants** should review updated eviction procedures and timelines, particularly around disputes involving unauthorized occupants.  
- **Counties and local law enforcement** will need to assess staffing, training, and compliance steps tied to **287(g) agreements**.  
- **Tech companies and any organization deploying AI** should evaluate whether their systems fall under HB 149’s definitions and begin documenting risk controls, testing practices, and accountability measures.

As these laws move from text to enforcement, the next chapters will likely be written in court challenges, agency guidance, and the day-to-day decisions of judges, sheriffs, appraisers, entrepreneurs, landlords, and renters—Texans who will determine how the state’s 2026 legal reset plays out in real life.
